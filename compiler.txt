Needs
=====
- parser
- Intel HEX file creator

Constraints
===========
- Can only be used for the Atmega2560
- Can only output to Intel HEX
- Must not take longer than a month to develop (So by the end of August, 2017)

Stage
=====
~~1. Design~~ Finished.
2. Prototype
3. Tweaks
4. Prototype II
5. Bug-fixes
6. Finalize
~~7. Support~~ Not needed.

Parser
======

Sample input
------------

	add r1, r2
	mov r1, r3      ;An instruction
	adiw r5:r4, 13  ;Another instruction

"add" is the mnenomic.
r1 and r2 are the operands.
spaces and commas are delimiters.
commas are specifically used to separate operands.
line feeds (or carriage returns + line feeds) demarcate the end of an instruction.

Parse process
-------------

### Line reading

0. Open the output file and defer its closure.

1. If it's the begining of the input or post newline and not empty, parse line.
2. First word is the mnemonic, and wont be more than 6 letters.  Exit with error if no space after 6 letters.
3. After extracting the mnemonic, find its value from a map.  If successful, continue.  Otherwise exit and error.
4. Add value of mnemonic to mnemonic buffer.
5. Lookup how many operands the instruction should have.  Remember that number.

Heres the hard part: operands can vary in size.
	Probably should implement a character limit for operands.  Let's go with 50 for now.

6. Read the line into a word buffer until a comma is reached or limit is hit.  Continue this step until all operands are filled.
     If a newline is hit before operands are filled, exit and error.
7. Continue reading, stopping at the next comma, space, or semicolon.
     If the rest of the line (other than delimiters) isnt a comment, exit and error.  Say "incorrect number of operands".
8. If there is a semicolon before the newline, read the characters inbetween into a comment buffer.
9. Construct line to write, then write line.

Repeat 1-10 until EOF.

	  mov      r1,          r3     ;An instruction
	   |        |            |            |
	  mBuff   opBuff[0]   opBuff[1]     cBuff

### Instruction construction

Each instruction is constructed differently, so you'd need a function for each.
The beginning of the instruction can be mapped, as well as register addresses.

Intel HEX file creator
======================
More details about the HEX file format can be found on wikipedia.

16-bit opcodes are sent little endian to the Atmega2560.
As in, the first byte (the one with the static code and the one listed first on the
	the AVR assembly documentation) is sent, followed usually by addresses and/or contants.
